# **ThinkClock Battery Analysis Project**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes **Li-ion battery performance** using data from **NASA Battery Dataset**. The dataset contains multiple operational profiles, including **charge, discharge, and impedance measurements**, collected at various temperatures.  

### **Key Objectives**  
- **Monitor battery degradation** over repeated charge-discharge cycles.  
- **Analyze impedance data** using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).  
- **Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** and state-of-health (SoH) of batteries.

## **Data Source**  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **NASA Battery Dataset** available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [NASA Battery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickfleith/nasa-battery-dataset/data)  

### **Dataset Description:**  
- Batteries were cycled through charge-discharge operations under different conditions.  
- Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to capture internal battery health.  
- Experiments continued until the batteries reached **End-of-Life (EOL)** conditions.
